# Task 04: Simulating and Resolving Merge Conflicts

Learn how to handle merge conflicts, a common scenario in team development.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Create conflicting branches:**
   - From `main`, create branch `feature/update-readme-v1`
   - Modify the title in `README.md` to "My Awesome Project v1"
   - Commit and switch back to `main`

2. **Create another conflicting branch:**
   - From `main`, create branch `feature/update-readme-v2`
   - Modify the same title in `README.md` to "My Super Project v2"
   - Commit this change

3. **Create and resolve conflict:**
   - Switch to `main` and merge `feature/update-readme-v1`
   - Try to merge `feature/update-readme-v2` (this will create a conflict)
   - Resolve the conflict by combining both titles creatively
   - Complete the merge with a proper commit message

## Document Your Work
Create `solutions/task-04.txt` with:
- All Git commands used
- Content of the conflict markers you saw
- How you resolved the conflict
- Final commit message for the merge
