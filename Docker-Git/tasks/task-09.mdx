# Task 09: Mastering Docker Commands and Image Management

Learn essential Docker commands for image and container management in development workflow.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Image Management Commands:**
   - Pull `nginx:alpine`, `redis:7-alpine`, and `node:24-alpine` images
   - List all images and inspect their details
   - Tag the nginx image with your custom tag
   - Save nginx image to a tar file and load it back
   - Remove specific images and clean up unused images

2. **Container Lifecycle Management:**
   - Run nginx container in detached mode with port mapping
   - Run redis container with custom name and restart policy
   - Create a Node.js container without starting it, then start it manually
   - Execute commands inside running containers (bash, redis-cli)
   - Copy files between host and containers

3. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting:**
   - Monitor container resource usage with stats
   - View and follow container logs with timestamps
   - Inspect container configuration and mounted volumes
   - Create and manage Docker volumes
   - Network troubleshooting between containers

4. **Cleanup and Maintenance:**
   - Stop all running containers
   - Remove containers, images, volumes, and networks
   - Use system prune commands to clean up unused resources
