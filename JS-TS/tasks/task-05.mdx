## Task 5: Bulk Operations and Selectors

**Description:**  
Add functions that operate on the entire todo collection and compute derived information.

**Requirements:**
1. In `solutions/todo-bulk.ts` implement:
   - `toggleAll(state: Todo[], completed: boolean): Todo[]` – marks every item as completed / not completed.
   - `clearCompleted(state: Todo[]): Todo[]` – removes completed todos.
   - `countByStatus(state: Todo[], status: TodoStatus): number`
2. All functions must be pure.
3. Use higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) – do not use `for` loops.
