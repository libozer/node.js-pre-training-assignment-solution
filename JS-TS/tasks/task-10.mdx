## Task 10: Build the `ToDoManager` Facade

**Description:**  
Create a single class that stitches every layer together and acts as the public API of your library or CLI app.

**Requirements:**
1. Implement `solutions/todo-manager.ts` exporting class `ToDoManager`.
2. Internally instantiate `InMemoryRepository`, `TodoApi`, and `TodoService`.
3. Expose a minimal synchronous interface:  
   - `init(): Promise<void>` – seed with demo data  
   - `add(title: string, description?: string): Promise<void>`  
   - `complete(id: number): Promise<void>`  
   - `list(): Promise<Todo[]>`
4. Provide a small **Node.js CLI** (in `solutions/index.ts`) that uses `process.argv` (or another lightweight approach) to call the manager.
5. Re-run all tests and ensure green.
